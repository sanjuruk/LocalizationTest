@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Localization

@* The IViewLocalizer can be injected into the view. It does two things of interest:
    1. It can HTML encode *parameters* passed to resource strings (not the resource strings themselves, as they may contain
       HTML) automatically, and return the result as an IHtmlContent so Razor won't HTML encode it again;
    2. It looks for localization resources for this view based on the view path, e.g. if the view's path is
       "MyApplication/Views/Home/Index.cshtml", then the corresponding resource base path will be "MyApplication.Views.Home.Index" *@

@inject IViewLocalizer Localizer

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = Localizer["Home Page"];
}

<div class="text-center">
    <h1 class="display-4">@Localizer["Welcome"]</h1>
    <p>@Localizer["Learn about"] <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core">@Localizer["building Web apps with ASP.NET Core"]</a>.</p>
